# php-poll-platform
## <img src="screenshots/logo.jpg" alt="QuestionHouse Logo" height= "100" width="100"/> QuestionHouse is a simple PHP-based poll platform that allows users to participate in polls created and managed by the system administrator.

## üìñ Description
This project was created in Greek as a training exercise for my university Web Development course in 2020.  
It represents one of my first attempts at web development, so there is plenty of room for improvement.  

**QuestionHouse** works with two roles:  
- **Admin**: creates and manages polls  
- **User**: participates by answering polls  

The purpose of this project was not to be a fully functional application, but rather to practice building a **basic login system** and applying **HTML/CSS knowledge** around a simple subject ‚Äî a poll platform.  
Apart from the login system, most of the remaining code functions mainly as **frontend prototypes** for training purposes.

## üöÄ Features
- Users can view and participate in polls  
- Admin can create, edit, and delete polls  
- Admin can manage and remove user profiles  
- Admin credentials are predefined by the system, ensuring that no additional admins can be created
